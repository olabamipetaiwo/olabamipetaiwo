### Hi there, I'm Olabamipe Taiwo 

I am a **PhD Student in Computer Science** specializing in **Security and Privacy** for Machine Learning systems. 

Leveraging 4+ years of professional Software Engineering experience, I bridge the gap between theoretical research and scalable, production-grade implementation. My goal is to apply rigorous academic research to solve real-world industry challenges in AI safety and model deployment.

### Current Focus & Research

I am currently transitioning from full-stack engineering to deep learning research. My active areas of work include:

* **PhD Research:** Investigating privacy discrepancies and data leakage in Large Language Models (LLMs).
* **Model Reproduction:** I am actively working on reproducing 15 top-tier ML papers (NeurIPS, CVPR, ICML) to bridge the gap between theory and code.
* **Deep Learning Tooling:** Leveraging my software engineering background to research and build robust tools that streamline Deep Learning workflows.

*(New ML projects and paper reproductions will be added here as they are completed.)*


### Production Engineering (Past Work)

Before starting my PhD, I built high-performance web applications for healthcare, fintech, and aviation. Some deployed solutions include:

* [GreenAfrica.com](https://www.greenafrica.com/) (Airline Booking Platform)
* [3MTT NITDA](https://3mtt.nitda.gov.ng/) (Government Tech Talent Portal)
* [Zupa.ng](https://zupa.ng/) (Sales & Inventory Management)
* [FlyAero.com](https://www.flyaero.com/) (Aviation Booking Engine)
* [HerVest.ng](https://hervest.ng/) (Fintech & Investment Platform)
* [Whatadeal.africa](https://whatadeal.africa/) (E-commerce Marketplace)
