Hi, I'm [Olabamipe Taiwo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olabamipe-taiwo-8753b9130/), I am a software engineer, a graduate of computer science with close to 4 years of experience with a specialization in creating and maintaining efficient software applications using a variety of appropriate web technologies that work across all platforms and browsers. I care deeply about building interfaces that are beautiful, usable, and pleasant for a diverse number of people possible, I have worked on a variety of projects in different industries ranging from health, Education, Ecommerce, Sales Tools, and Airlines, and my recent experience from the crypto world.

<br />

My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages such as JavaScript, Typescript, Php, and a little bit of Python for ML. I also have extensive knowledge of libraries and frameworks like React, React-Native, Vue, Next, Nuxt, Laravel, and ExpressJs, and testing tools such as Cypress, Jest, & React-testing-library on the FE side of things. I pay attention to concepts such as Page
 Optimization(speed & SEO), Accessibility, and Responsive design to create performant products with delightful user experiences.
 
<br />
I have experience in communicating with stakeholders, other technical teams, and management to collect requirements and describe software product features, and technical designs, I understand the importance of working closely with team members and stakeholders to deliver high-quality software that meets the needs of the end-users, thus generating revenue for the company. I prioritize staying up-to-date with the latest technology trends and applying them to improve the efficiency and functionality of the software applications I work on.
