<br />

I am a **PhD Student in Computer Science** specializing in **Security and Privacy** for Machine Learning systems. 

Leveraging 4+ years of professional Software Engineering experience, I bridge the gap between theoretical research and scalable, production-grade implementation. My goal is to apply rigorous academic research to solve real-world industry challenges in AI safety and model deployment.

### 🔭 Current Focus & Research

I am currently transitioning from full-stack engineering to deep learning research. My active areas of work include:

* **PhD Research:** Investigating privacy discrepancies and data leakage in Large Language Models (LLMs).
* **Model Reproduction:** I am actively working on reproducing 15 top-tier ML papers (NeurIPS, CVPR, ICML) to bridge the gap between theory and code.
* **Open Source:** Leading the frontend architecture for collaborative streaming platforms.

*(New ML projects and paper reproductions will be added here as they are completed.)*
